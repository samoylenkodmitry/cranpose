# Modifier ≈ Jetpack Compose Parity Plan

Goal: match Jetpack Compose’s `Modifier` API surface and `Modifier.Node` runtime semantics so Kotlin samples and mental models apply 1:1 in Compose-RS.

---

## Current Gaps (Compose-RS)
- `Modifier` is still an Rc-backed builder with cached layout/draw state for legacy APIs. Renderers now read reconciled node slices, but `ModifierState` continues to provide padding/layout caches and must be removed once every factory is node-backed.
- Diagnostics exist (`Modifier::fmt`, `debug::log_modifier_chain`, `COMPOSE_DEBUG_MODIFIERS`), but we still lack parity tooling such as Kotlin's inspector strings, capability dumps with delegate depth, per-node tracing toggles, and focused tracing hooks used by focus/pointer stacks.

## Jetpack Compose Reference Anchors
- `Modifier.kt`: immutable interface (`EmptyModifier`, `CombinedModifier`) plus `foldIn`, `foldOut`, `any`, `all`, `then`.
- `ModifierNodeElement.kt`: node-backed elements with `create`/`update`/`key`/`equals`/`hashCode`/inspector hooks.
- `NodeChain.kt`, `DelegatableNode.kt`, `NodeKind.kt`: sentinel-based chain, capability masks, delegate links, targeted invalidations, and traversal helpers.
- Pointer input stack under `/media/huge/composerepo/compose/ui/ui/src/commonMain/kotlin/androidx/compose/ui/input/pointer`.

## Recent Progress
- `ModifierNodeChain` now stores safe sentinel head/tail nodes and aggregate capability masks without `unsafe`, enabling deterministic traversal order and `COMPOSE_DEBUG_MODIFIERS` dumps.
- Modifier locals graduated to a Kotlin-style manager: providers/consumers stay registered per chain, invalidations return from `ModifierChainHandle`, layout nodes resolve ancestor values via a registry, and regression tests now cover overrides + ancestor propagation.
- Layout nodes expose modifier-local data to ancestors without raw pointers: `ModifierChainHandle` shares a `ModifierLocalsHandle`, `LayoutNode` updates a pointer-free registry entry, and `resolve_modifier_local_from_parent_chain` now mirrors Kotlin's `ModifierLocalManager` traversal while staying completely safe.
- Diagnostics improved: `Modifier` implements `Display`, `compose_ui::debug::log_modifier_chain` enumerates nodes/capabilities, and DEBUG env flags print chains after reconciliation.
- Core modifier factories (`padding`, `background`, `draw*`, `clipToBounds`, `pointerInput`, `clickable`) are node-backed, and pointer input runs on coroutine-driven scaffolding mirroring Kotlin. Renderers and pointer dispatch now operate exclusively on reconciled node slices.
- `ModifierNodeChain` now mirrors Kotlin's delegate semantics: every node exposes parent/child links, delegate stacks feed the traversal helpers, aggregate capability masks propagate through delegates, and tests cover ordering, sentinel wiring, and capability short-circuiting without any `unsafe`.
- Runtime consumers (modifier locals, pointer input, semantics helpers, diagnostics, and resolver pipelines) now use the delegate-aware traversal helpers exclusively; the legacy iterator APIs were removed and tests cover delegated capability discovery.
- **Semantics tree is now fully modifier-driven:** `SemanticsOwner` caches configurations by `NodeId`, `build_semantics_node` derives roles/actions exclusively from `SemanticsConfiguration` flags, semantics dirty flag is independent of layout, and capability-filtered traversal respects delegate depth. `RuntimeNodeMetadata` removed from the semantics extraction path.
- **Focus chain parity achieved:** `FocusTargetNode` and `FocusRequesterNode` implement full `ModifierNode` lifecycle, focus traversal uses `NodeCapabilities::FOCUS` with delegate-aware visitors (`find_parent_focus_target`, `find_first_focus_target`), `FocusManager` tracks state without unsafe code, focus invalidations are independent of layout/draw, and all 6 tests pass covering lifecycle, callbacks, chain integration, and state predicates.

## Migration Plan
1. **Mirror the `Modifier` data model (Kotlin: `Modifier.kt`)**  
   Keep the fluent API identical (fold helpers, `any`/`all`, inspector metadata) and delete the remaining runtime responsibilities of `ModifierState` once all factories are node-backed.
2. **Adopt `ModifierNodeElement` / `Modifier.Node` parity (Kotlin: `ModifierNodeElement.kt`)**  
   Implement the full lifecycle contract: `onAttach`, `onDetach`, `onReset`, coroutine scope ownership, and equality/key-driven reuse.
3. **Implement delegate traversal + capability plumbing (Kotlin: `NodeChain.kt`, `NodeKind.kt`, `DelegatableNode.kt`)**
   ✅ Delegate stacks + traversal helpers now match Kotlin. Focus subsystem now uses capability-aware short-circuiting.
4. **Wire all runtime subsystems through chains**
   ✅ Layout/draw/pointer/semantics/focus now read reconciled nodes exclusively via delegate-aware traversal. **Remaining:** remove residual `ModifierState` caches.
5. **Migrate modifier factories + diagnostics**  
   Finish porting the remaining factories off `ModifierState`, add Kotlin-style inspector dumps/trace hooks, and grow the parity test matrix to compare traversal order/capabilities against the Android reference.

## Near-Term Next Steps
1. **(✅) Focus chain parity**
   - ✅ Focus manager/requester utilities now use `ModifierNodeChain`'s delegate traversal helpers with `NodeCapabilities::FOCUS` short-circuiting.
   - ✅ Focus target/requester nodes implement full `ModifierNode` lifecycle (`onAttach`, `onDetach`).
   - ✅ Traversal helpers (`find_parent_focus_target`, `find_first_focus_target`) use capability-filtered visitors.
   - ✅ Tests cover lifecycle, callbacks, chain integration, delegation, and state predicates.
2. **(✅) Semantics stack parity**
   - ✅ `SemanticsOwner` caches `SemanticsConfiguration` per node, lazily computes on access, and supports invalidation.
   - ✅ `build_semantics_node` derives roles/actions from configuration flags (not widget types), respects capability masks, and clears semantics dirty flags.
   - ✅ Tests cover caching, role synthesis, multiple modifier merging, and semantics-only updates.
3. **Modifier factory audit & `ModifierState` removal**
   - Audit every `Modifier` factory to ensure it's fully node-backed (currently: `padding`, `background`, `draw*`, `clipToBounds`, `pointerInput`, `clickable`, `focusTarget`, `semantics` are done).
   - Migrate remaining factories (`offset`, `size`, `weight`, alignment helpers, intrinsic size modifiers) to use element-backed nodes.
   - Remove `ModifierState` struct once all factories operate exclusively through reconciled node chains.
   - Update `Modifier::resolved_modifiers()` to build from nodes only, eliminating legacy cache consultation.
4. **Enhanced diagnostics & inspector parity**
   - Extend debugging helpers (`Modifier::to_string()`, chain dumps) to include delegate depth, modifier locals provided, semantics/focus flags, and capability masks.
   - Port Kotlin's inspector strings and per-node tracing (`NodeChain#trace`) so modifier/focus/pointer debugging can be toggled per-layout-node (not just via `COMPOSE_DEBUG_MODIFIERS`).
   - Add capability-aware chain visualization showing which nodes respond to which invalidations.

## Roadmap: Closing Runtime/Parity Gaps

### Phase 1 — Stabilize “where does resolved data come from?”

**Targets:** gap 3, shortcuts 1, wifn 1–3

1. **Centralize resolved-modifier computation**

   * **Goal:** resolved data is computed exactly once per layout-owning thing (`LayoutNode`, `SubcomposeLayoutNode`), never ad-hoc.
   * **Actions:**

     * Keep `LayoutNode`’s current `modifier_chain.update(...)` + `resolved_modifiers` as the **source of truth**.
     * Make `SubcomposeLayoutNodeInner` do the same (it already does, just confirm it mirrors the layout node path).
     * Mark `Modifier::resolved_modifiers()` as “helper/debug-only” and hunt down any call sites in layout/measure/text that still use it.
   * **Acceptance:**

     * No hot path calls `Modifier::resolved_modifiers()` directly.
     * Renderer and layout both consume the snapshot coming from `LayoutNodeData`.

2. **Make all layout-tree builders provide the 3-part node data**

   * **Goal:** every constructed `LayoutNodeData` has

     ```rust
     LayoutNodeData::new(
       modifier,
       resolved_modifiers,
       modifier_slices,
       kind,
     )
     ```
   * **Actions:**

     * Audit places that build layout trees (debug tests, runtime metadata trees, any virtual/layout wrappers) and update them to call the new constructor.
     * Add a tiny test that builds a minimal layout tree and asserts `modifier_slices` is non-None / default.
   * **Acceptance:**

     * `cargo check` over ui + both renderers succeeds after the constructor change.
     * No `LayoutNodeData { modifier, kind }` left.

3. **Make resolved modifiers fully node-first**

   * **Goal:** stop “build from legacy ModifierState and then patch from nodes.”
   * **Actions:**

     * Move the logic from `ModifierChainHandle::compute_resolved(...)` so it **starts** from the chain (layout nodes, draw nodes, shape nodes) and only *optionally* consults legacy fields.
     * Keep the current order for now (padding → background → shape → graphics layer) but document “this is 100% node-backed once all factories are node-backed.”
   * **Acceptance:**

     * The resolved struct can be explained using only “what nodes were in the chain.”

---

### Phase 2 — Modifier locals that actually do something

**Targets:** gap 5, shortcut 3, wifn 4

1. **(✅) Wire `ModifierLocalManager` to layout nodes**

   * Provider changes now surface through `ModifierChainHandle::update_with_resolver`, the manager returns invalidation kinds, and `LayoutNode` bubbles the result into its dirty flags/tests.

2. **(✅) Add ancestor walking for locals**

   * Layout nodes maintain a registry of living parents so modifier-local consumers can resolve ancestors exactly like Kotlin’s `visitAncestors`, with capability short-circuiting tied to `modifier_child_capabilities`.

3. **Make debug toggling less global**

   * **Goal:** avoid “env var = everything logs.”
   * **Actions:**

     * Keep `COMPOSE_DEBUG_MODIFIERS` for now, but add a per-node switch the layout node can set (`layout_node.set_debug_modifiers(true)`).
     * Route chain logging through that.
   * **Acceptance:**

     * You can turn on modifier-debug for one node without spamming the whole tree.

---

### Phase 3 — Semantics on top of modifier nodes

**Status:** ✅ Done (semantics tree is fully modifier-driven; `SemanticsOwner` caches configurations, roles/actions derive from `SemanticsConfiguration` flags, and semantics invalidations are independent of layout. Tests cover caching, role synthesis, and capability-filtered traversal.)

---

### Phase 4 — Clean up the “shortcut” APIs on nodes

**Targets:** shortcuts 4, 5

1. **Replace per-node `as_*_node` with mask-driven dispatch**

   * **Goal:** not every user node has to implement 4 optional methods.
   * **Actions:**

     * Where you iterate now with `draw_nodes()`, `pointer_input_nodes()`, switch to: use the chain entries’ capability bits as the primary filter, and only downcast the node once.
     * Keep the `as_*` methods for now for built-ins, but don’t require third parties to override them.
   * **Acceptance:**

     * A node with the DRAW capability but no `as_draw_node` still gets visited.

2. **Make invalidation routing match the mask**

   * **Goal:** stop doing “draw → mark_needs_layout.”
   * **Actions:**

     * Add a `mark_needs_redraw()` or equivalent on the node/renderer path and call that for DRAW invalidations.
   * **Acceptance:**

     * DRAW-only updates don’t force layout.

---

### Phase 5 — Finish traversal utilities (the Kotlin-like part)

**Status:** ✅ Done (modifier locals, semantics, pointer input, diagnostics, and tests now rely solely on the capability-filtered visitors; bespoke iterators were removed. Remaining traversal work lives under focus + semantics tree follow-ups.)
